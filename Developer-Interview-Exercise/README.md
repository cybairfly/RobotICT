# Buzzword Generator
*Divisibility checker for everyday people*

Utility to assign labels to a range of numbers based on their divisibility, using custom rules specified on input along with the range.

## Interface
### Range
Define a range of numbers between 1-100

### Rules
Define labels for divisors of the number range.

### History
Revisit results created by previous submissions.

## Objective
Generic implementation of:

**Write an application that would go through numbers from 1 to 100.**

The application should consist of a single page (multiple pages are optional if your design requires them) containing a list (table, plain text, etc.) of words:
- "Robot" if the number is divisible by 3,
- "ICT" if the number is divisible by 5,
- "RobotICT" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.

In all other cases, the application should print just the number.
